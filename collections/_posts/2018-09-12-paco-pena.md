>'Vimala Rowe is a valuable addition to the line-up of flamenco artists not only for her wonderful voice, but because – in "Martinete" at least – she sings in English, and so conveys, through her bluesy lyrics, what it must be like to understand flamenco songs, which are often searing poems about loss, anger, or simply a bittersweet moment in time. With the very dark lighting and black costumes used in this piece, the dancers – executing a more contemporary staggered sequence of movements – take second place to the splendid Rowe's visceral, physical singing'  theartsdesk.com
